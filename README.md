## This program creates a ***square and a triangle*** using an asterisk ( * ) in the *console window* depending on the value entered by the user.

### The project consists of the following sections. 

1. Draw a square:

I receive the height and width of the square from the user via heightUserInput and widthUserInput and create a square in the console window using an asterisk ( * ).
